# About liftyee.com

Hi! I'm Victor, the creator of this site. I make things. Right now those things tend to be electronic, but my inbox is open to suggestions!

I like figuring out how engineered devices work and learning by doing (aka "fail until you understand it").
This website is the 6th(?) iteration of my little corner of the internet. 

I'm currently studying the Engineering Tripos at the University of Cambridge.

As of July 2025, I am a strong supporter of open-source software and the [right-to-repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) movement. 

As the footer probably says, this website is built with Hugo static-site generator and edited in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
