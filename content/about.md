# About liftyee.com

Hi! I'm Victor, the creator of this site. I make things. Right now those things tend to be electronic, but my inbox is open to suggestions!

I like figuring out how electronics work and learning by doing (aka "fail until you understand it").
This website is the 6 (?) th iteration of my little corner of the internet. 

Currently studying the Engineering Tripos at the University of Cambridge.
As of July 2025, I am a strong supporter of open-source software and the [right-to-repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) movement. 

As the footer probably says, this website is built with Hugo static-site generator and edited in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
